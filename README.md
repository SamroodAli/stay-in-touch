## Getting started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SamroodAli/ror-social-scaffold.git
$ cd members-only
```
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the development branch
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development ]

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, setup webpacker configuration

```
$ rails webpacker:install
```

After that, create and migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

To run the project on rails local server:

```
$ rails server
```
## Deploying

To deploy the sample app to production, youâ€™ll need a Heroku account

To deploy this version of the app, youâ€™ll need to create a new Heroku application, switch to the right branch, push up the source, run the migrations, and seed the database with sample users:

```
$ heroku create
$ git checkout updating-users
$ git push heroku updating-users:master
$ heroku run rails db:migrate
$ heroku run rails db:seed
```

Visiting the URL returned by the original `heroku create` should now show you the sample app running in production. 

## Branches

Simply check out the corresponding branch using `git checkout`:

```
$ git checkout <branch name>
```
